# cataclysm-bn-dead-world-mapgen
A mod for C:BN which attempts to make the game feel more like a post-nuclear dead wasteland, without tweaking your preferable world settings, so you can use it on top of your own hardcore tweaks.

This mod works by replacing some of game files. 
Last updated for Nightly 2025-10-31

1) Removed most of live vegetation from world map.
2) Most of reliable food sources which was not tied to spawn settings tweaked during world creation have been removed or replaced. Hunting no longer gives normal meat and fish. Instead, they've been replaced with mutant meat and fat. You can still get animal entrails. Butchery from Triffid is also nerfed. Butchery from humans still gives  human meat, fat and bones. Mutant meat is also poisonus, and is scarce, mostly replaced with tainted meat. Blob is everywhere.
3) Some of still water sources are replaced with salt water or sewage.
4) Most of vanilla pre-made locations such as farms, farm fields, apple orchards, ect. have been tweaked to remove food sources from them.
5) "Irradiated" status effect is no longer visible for the player. Use geiger counter or other tools. I've also included randomly placed radiation zones across the map.
6) Removed some overpowered mapgen extras from the game, like supply crates and military corpses.
