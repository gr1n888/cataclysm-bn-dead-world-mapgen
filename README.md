# cataclysm-bn-dead-world-mapgen
A mod for C:BN which attempts to make the game feel more like a post-nuclear dead wasteland, without tweaking your preferable world settings, so you can use it on top of your own hardcore tweaks.

This mod works by replacing some of game files. Last files have been updated for the unstable version released 03/08/25. 

1) Removed most of live vegetation from world map.
2) Most of reliable food sources which was not tied to spawn settings tweaked during world creation have been removed or replaced. Hunting no longer gives normal meat and fish. Instead, they've been replaced with mutant meat and fat. You can still get animal entrails. Butchery from Triffid is also nerfed. Butchery from humans still gives some human meat, fat and bones. 
3) Most of still water sources are replaced with salt water or sewage.
4) Most of vanilla pre-made locations such as farms, farm fields, apple orchards, ect. have been tweaked to remove food sources from them.
5) "Irradiated" status effect is no longer visible for the player. Use geiger counter or other tools. I've also tried to inclure randomly placed radiation zones across the map, but results were unsatisfactory and it's no longer avaliable, maybe I will come back to it later.
